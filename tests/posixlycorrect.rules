 * The goal of this test is to verify that we are getting the
 * counter-intuitive POSIX behavior of the repeat operator `{}' when
 * posix_compat is off but POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 is set in the
 * environment. Note: This depends on the test framework to actually
 * set that variable!  When it does not, Flex will match abbb
 *
 *  ab{3} -  In traditional flex, this matches "abbb".
 *           In posix, this matches "ababab".
 * The input file should contain just the second string.
